# Photomode Cheat Tables

A collection of cheat tables created by myself to enable various photographic features in certain games. Each table has a different featureset and ranges from freecams to photomode limit removals.

To use these files, you need to have Cheat Engine installed. You can get the latest version here: https://www.cheatengine.org/

Once you have that installed, run the game and open the .ct file with Cheat Engine (or start Cheat Engine and open through there). Once CE is attached to the game process you will be able to use the features in the table.
